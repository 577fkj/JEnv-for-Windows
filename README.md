# JEnv for Windows
## change your current Java version with 3 words

 - JEnv allows you to change your current JDK Version.
 - This is helpful for testing or if you have projects requiring
   different versions of java
 - For example you can build a gradle project
   which requires java8 without changing your enviroment variables and
   then switch back to work with java15
 - It's written in cmd and powershell so it can change the enviroment variables and can run on any Windows-10+.

I hope you enjoy it
